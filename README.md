# PCA
 
Data used is from sklearn's built-in dataset containing information about breast cancer. There are two possible outcomes - malignant and benign. The dataset contains 30 features, but with PCA it is reduced to 2. Logistic regression is performed to see how good will it be after the PCA.
Features in the set:

radius (mean)
texture (mean)
perimeter (mean)
area (mean)
smoothness (mean)
compactness (mean)
concavity (mean)
concave points (mean)
symmetry (mean)
fractal dimension (mean)
radius (standard error)
texture (standard error)
perimeter (standard error)
area (standard error)
smoothness (standard error)
compactness (standard error)
concavity (standard error)
concave points (standard error)

fractal dimension (standard error)
